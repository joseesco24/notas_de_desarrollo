# About this repository

The unique goal of this repository is to save and have available my personal notes about some of the most important technologies that I've learned and could be useful for me in the future in a really strange case where i forget how to use them, i these case these notes would become very useful to me to remember how to use some of these technologies.\
Also, some of these notes have some cool diagrams that I draw to make each note more clear and easier to understand, but i draw them thinking that i use the dark mode almost anywhere, so if the dark mode is not active some of these diagrams may not be clearly visibles, if you could see the gif below this paragraph this means that the diagrams in the notes are going to be clearly visible.
